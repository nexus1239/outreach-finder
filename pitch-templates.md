# Outreach Email Templates

Three ready-to-send templates for guest post pitches.
**Replace every `[BRACKETED]` field before sending.**

---

## Template A — Value-First Pitch
*Offer a specific article idea with a full outline.*
**Best for:** Blogs with clear editorial guidelines and an obvious content gap you can fill.

**Subject:** Guest post idea for [SITE_NAME]: "[ARTICLE_TITLE]"

---

Hi [EDITOR_NAME],

I'm a [BRIEF_CREDENTIAL] who covers [YOUR_NICHE] at [MY_SITE]. I've been following [SITE_NAME] for a while — your piece on [REFERENCE_SPECIFIC_ARTICLE] was especially good.

I'd love to contribute a guest post titled:

**"[ARTICLE_TITLE]"**

Quick outline:

1. **Introduction** — [1-2 sentence hook: the specific problem/question the article addresses]
2. **[SECTION_1_TITLE]** — [what this covers and why it matters to their audience]
3. **[SECTION_2_TITLE]** — [what this covers and why it matters to their audience]
4. **[SECTION_3_TITLE]** — [what this covers and why it matters to their audience]
5. **Key takeaways** — [what the reader walks away knowing or able to do]

The article would be ~[WORD_COUNT] words, backed by [peer-reviewed research / primary sources / original data]. I can deliver a polished draft within [TIMEFRAME, e.g. 5 business days].

Does this fit your editorial calendar? Happy to adjust the angle or swap sections if you have a better fit in mind.

Best,
[MY_NAME]
[MY_SITE]
[MY_EMAIL]

## Template B — Data / Research Pitch
*Offer exclusive original data or a new analysis.*
**Best for:** Blogs that publish data-driven features, case studies, or industry reports.

**Subject:** Exclusive data piece for [SITE_NAME] — [RESEARCH_TOPIC]

---

Hi [EDITOR_NAME],

My name is [MY_NAME] — I run [MY_SITE] and have been writing about [YOUR_NICHE] for [TIME_PERIOD].

I'm reaching out because I've just finished an analysis I think would land well with [SITE_NAME]'s audience:

**"[ARTICLE_TITLE]: What [DATA_SOURCE] Reveals About [TOPIC]"**

Three headline findings:

- **[FINDING_1]** — [why this is surprising or important]
- **[FINDING_2]** — [why this is relevant to your specific reader]
- **[FINDING_3]** — [the actionable implication]

This data hasn't been published anywhere. I'd like to offer [SITE_NAME] first publication, with full methodology included, in exchange for a byline and one contextual link back to [MY_SITE].

I can share a draft or the raw dataset for review first — whichever you prefer.

Best,
[MY_NAME]
[MY_SITE]
[MY_EMAIL]

---

## Template C — Expert Quote / Roundup Contribution
*Offer a short, citable expert perspective.*
**Best for:** Blogs that publish expert roundups, or as a low-friction first touchpoint before pitching a full article.

**Subject:** Expert quote for [SITE_NAME] — [TOPIC]

---

Hi [EDITOR_NAME],

I came across [SITE_NAME] while researching [TOPIC] and noticed you publish expert roundup posts — the one on [REFERENCE_SPECIFIC_ROUNDUP] was a great read.

I'd love to contribute an expert perspective to any upcoming piece you're working on. Topics where I can add genuine depth:

- [TOPIC_1]
- [TOPIC_2]
- [TOPIC_3]

About me: [1-2 sentence bio — credential, what you're known for, your site]. I can provide a [100–200 word] comment with a study citation or data point if that helps.

No payment needed — just a byline and site link if published.

If you don't have a roundup in the works, I'm also happy to pitch a standalone article. Let me know what fits.

Best,
[MY_NAME]
[MY_SITE]
[MY_EMAIL]

## Personalisation Checklist

Before hitting send on any template, confirm:

- [ ] `[SITE_NAME]` — the blog's name (not the domain)
- [ ] `[EDITOR_NAME]` — check the About page, Contact page, or LinkedIn. Use "Hi there" if genuinely unknown
- [ ] `[ARTICLE_TITLE]` — a specific headline, not a topic area
- [ ] `[REFERENCE_SPECIFIC_ARTICLE]` — shows you actually read their site (Template A / C)
- [ ] `[FINDING_1/2/3]` — real numbers, not placeholders (Template B)
- [ ] `[TOPIC_1/2/3]` — relevant to *that blog's* specific audience (Template C)
- [ ] `[MY_NAME]`, `[MY_SITE]`, `[MY_EMAIL]` — your actual details

## Sending Tips

- **Domain email only** — send from yourname@yoursite.com, not Gmail
- **Warm before cold** — follow the blog on social and engage with one post before emailing
- **One follow-up** — if no reply after 5–7 business days, one short nudge is fine. Then move on
- **Track everything** — use the `status` column in `outreach-targets.csv`:
  - `Sent` → `Replied` → `Accepted` / `Rejected` / `Ghosted`
- **Avoid Mondays and Fridays** — Tuesday–Thursday morning (recipient's timezone) gets the best open rates
