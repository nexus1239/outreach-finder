### 1. Intelligent Labs — `support@intelligentlabs.org`
**Submit:** https://www.intelligentlabs.org/write-for-us/
**Niche:** Nootropics supplements brand blog
**Why them:** They literally have a "Write For Us" page and sell nootropics — perfect fit.

**Subject:** Guest post for Intelligent Labs: "Piracetam + Alpha-GPC: The Original Stack, Revisited"

Hi there,

I'm a researcher and writer at Cognitive Edge (cognitiveedge.org), where we publish evidence-based guides on prescription nootropics and cognitive enhancement compounds.

I'd love to contribute a guest post to Intelligent Labs titled:

**"Piracetam + Alpha-GPC: The Original Nootropic Stack, Revisited With 2025 Research"**

Outline:
1. Why piracetam was the compound that coined the word "nootropic" (1964 origins)
2. The mechanism — AMPA receptor modulation and why it depletes choline
3. Why Alpha-GPC became the standard pairing: bioavailability vs citicoline
4. Updated dosing protocols based on recent literature
5. Who benefits most (and who doesn't)

~1,800 words, fully referenced, no product promotion. I'm happy to include a natural mention of Intelligent Labs where relevant if that suits your guidelines.

Would this fit your editorial calendar?

**Why them:** Active write-for-us page on a dedicated nootropics blog — highest relevance.

**Subject:** Guest post pitch for Nootrolux: "Racetam Comparison 2026: Which One Is Actually Right for You?"

Hi there,

I run Cognitive Edge (cognitiveedge.org), an evidence-based guide covering nootropic compounds from piracetam to modafinil to atomoxetine.

I noticed Nootrolux covers the racetam family and I'd love to contribute:

**"Racetam Comparison 2026: Piracetam vs Aniracetam vs Oxiracetam vs Pramiracetam"**

Quick outline:
1. What all racetams share (AMPA modulation, choline depletion)
2. Piracetam — the baseline, why it's the right starting point
3. Aniracetam — the anxiolytic/creative racetam (mechanism: 5-HT2A + mGluR)
4. Oxiracetam — the analytical/stimulating racetam
5. Pramiracetam — the memory-focused, high-potency option
6. Comparison table: dose, fat-solubility, half-life, best use case
7. Choline stacking: Alpha-GPC vs citicoline for each

~2,000 words, peer-reviewed references throughout. No affiliate links.

### 3. Cogbites — `cogbitesblog@gmail.com`
**Submit:** https://cogbites.org/write_for_us/
**Niche:** Cognitive science & brain research blog
**Why them:** Explicit "write for us" page with submission guidelines — academic-friendly audience.

**Subject:** Guest post for Cogbites: "What does the evidence actually say about nootropics?"

Hi,

I'm a writer at Cognitive Edge (cognitiveedge.org), where I translate neuropharmacology research into accessible guides for general readers.

I'd love to contribute to Cogbites with a piece titled:

**"Smart Drugs vs. Real Evidence: What the Research Actually Shows About Cognitive Enhancement"**

Outline:
1. The problem with the nootropics category — marketing vs mechanism
2. Tier 1: Compounds with robust human RCT evidence (caffeine + L-theanine, modafinil in sleep-deprived subjects)
3. Tier 2: Compounds with consistent but limited evidence (piracetam in older adults, bacopa monnieri)
4. Tier 3: Promising but premature (lion's mane, PQQ)
5. The methodological challenges: measuring cognition is hard
6. How readers can critically evaluate claims themselves

~1,600 words, all claims linked to peer-reviewed sources (PubMed, Cochrane). Written in line with Cogbites' evidence-focused tone.

I've read your piece on working memory interventions — loved the breakdown of the transfer debate. This would sit nicely alongside it.

### 4. iThrivein — `anuj@ithrivein.com`
**Submit:** https://www.ithrivein.com/write-for-us
**Niche:** Health & wellness blog
**Why them:** Active write-for-us page with email — health-focused audience that overlaps nootropics readers.

**Subject:** Guest post for iThrivein: "The Beginner's Brain Stack: 3 Compounds, 3 Weeks, Measurable Results"

Hi Anuj,

I write about cognitive enhancement and nootropics at Cognitive Edge (cognitiveedge.org). I noticed iThrivein covers practical health optimisation and thought your audience might enjoy a grounded, actionable guide on brain supplements.

I'd like to pitch:

**"The Beginner's Brain Stack: 3 Compounds, 3 Weeks, What to Actually Expect"**

Outline:
1. Why most nootropic guides overwhelm beginners
2. The three-compound starter stack: caffeine + L-theanine + bacopa monnieri
3. Week-by-week what to expect (caffeine+L-theanine works Day 1; bacopa takes 3 weeks)
4. How to track your own baseline and measure change
5. What to add next — and what to avoid
6. The non-supplement interventions that outperform all of the above (sleep, exercise)

~1,500 words. Practical, skeptical, and references the research without being dry. Includes a simple self-tracking table your readers can copy.

Happy to discuss the angle further.

**Niche:** Dedicated nootropics/cognitive enhancement blog
**Why them:** High-relevance nootropics blog with a visible write-for-us page. Use their contact form.

**Subject:** Guest post for Corpina: "Modafinil vs Atomoxetine: A Mechanism-First Comparison"

Hi,

I'm the writer behind Cognitive Edge (cognitiveedge.org), which covers prescription and OTC nootropics with a focus on pharmacology over hype.

I'd love to contribute to Corpina:

**"Modafinil vs Atomoxetine: Two Very Different Paths to the Same Desk"**

Outline:
1. How they differ at the receptor level (modafinil: orexin + dopamine reuptake; atomoxetine: selective NRI)
2. Wakefulness vs focus — why modafinil suits fatigue and atomoxetine suits distraction
3. Duration profiles: modafinil's 12–15h vs atomoxetine's steady-state buildup
4. Side effect comparison (appetite, sleep, cardiovascular)
5. Who should choose which (and who shouldn't use either)
6. Stacking considerations

~2,000 words, peer-reviewed throughout. This is a comparison I haven't seen done justice anywhere — most guides conflate the mechanisms.

### 6. Hormonally — `info@hormonally.org`
**Contact:** https://hormonally.org/contact/
**Niche:** Women's biohacking & hormonal health
**Note:** Angle toward female-specific nootropic considerations.

**Subject:** Guest post for Hormonally: "Biohacking Your Brain: Which Nootropics Are Actually Safe for Women?"

Hi,

I run Cognitive Edge (cognitiveedge.org), where I write evidence-based guides on cognitive enhancement compounds. I'd like to pitch a piece for Hormonally that your audience probably hasn't seen done properly:

**"Biohacking Your Brain: Which Nootropics Are Safe for Women — and Which Aren't"**

Most nootropics research was conducted on male subjects. This piece would cover:
1. Why sex differences matter for nootropics (metabolism, hormonal cycling, thyroid interactions)
2. The safest evidence-backed options for women (L-theanine + caffeine, ashwagandha, magnesium)
3. Compounds where female-specific data is lacking (racetams, modafinil)
4. How the menstrual cycle affects cognitive performance — and what to take when
5. Red flags: compounds that interact with contraceptives or thyroid medication

~1,800 words. Fully referenced. This would be a unique addition to Hormonally's content.

Hi,

I run Cognitive Edge (cognitiveedge.org) and have been following Nootropics Depot's educational content for a while — it's some of the most accurate supplier content in the space.

I'd love to contribute a mechanism-focused article:

**"AMPA Receptor Modulation Explained: Why It's the Key to Understanding Racetams"**

Content:
1. What AMPA receptors do in memory and learning (LTP, synaptic plasticity)
2. How piracetam modulates them — and why this is different from direct agonism
3. What varies across the racetam family: aniracetam's AMPA kinetics vs piracetam's
4. Why choline depletion is a predictable consequence (and how to prevent it)
5. What recent 2023–2025 research adds to our understanding

Hi,

I write about cognitive enhancement at Cognitive Edge (cognitiveedge.org). Your "Guest Blogger: Brain Enhancement" page caught my eye — I'd like to contribute something that bridges the psychology and pharmacology angles.

**"The Psychology of Nootropics: Placebo, Expectation, and Actual Effect"**

Outline:
1. The placebo problem in cognitive enhancement research (and why it's particularly severe here)
2. How expectation shapes subjective cognitive performance
3. What controlled trials actually find when you strip out placebo
4. The compounds where genuine effects survive placebo-controlled design
5. What this means for self-experimentation: how to test yourself honestly

~1,500 words. This would appeal to your psychologically-minded readership who want to think critically about the nootropics conversation.
